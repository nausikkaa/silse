<p>
  JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),<br>[10] often abbreviated to JS,
   is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
    alongside HTML and CSS.[11] As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript
    <br>on the client side for webpage behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.<br>
    [13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

   JavaScript is a high-level,
   often just-in-time compiled language that conforms
   to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
   and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional,
   and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces
   (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
   and the Document Object Model (DOM).
